learning my way around the computer.  I need to understand were things are and when to use them.  My navigation through the computer needs to fallow what I am thinking, in order to keep my stream of conciousness flowing.
Having to think about where things and are and then trying physically search for them has to be one fluid process.
The computer and my thoughts have to flow simultaneously to just straight produce.  Shortcuts on the keyboard and typing skills are a major factor in accomplishing this goal.
Once computer fluidity and understanding of coding, I should be able to quickly produce working, well written code which to me is the big picture for this class and the beggining of my career.
I'm starting to understand.
